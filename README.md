This repository includes code and data for the publication "The Impact of Incumbent/Opposition Status and Ideological Similitude on Emotions in Political Manifestos." by Takumi Nishi

Abstract: 
This study analyzes emotion-associated language in the United Kingdom’s Conservative and Labour Parties’ general election manifestos from 2001 to 2019. While previous research has shown a correlation between ideology and positions in policy, there are still conflicting results in matters of the sentiments in such manifestos. Using new data, we present how a manifestos’ valence level can be swayed by a party’s status in government, with incumbent parties presenting a higher frequency in positive emotion-associated words while negative emotion-associated words are more prevalent in opposition parties. We also demonstrate that parties with ideological similitude use positive language prominently, further adding to the literature on the relationship between sentiments and party status.
